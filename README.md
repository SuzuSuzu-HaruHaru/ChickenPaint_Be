# ChickenPaint_for_Petit_Note_bs5

## Building

In the root of ChickenPaint, run `npm install` to install required dependencies. 
Then run `make all` to build ChickenPaint.

## Usage

Include ChickenPaint's main JS and CSS files:

```html
//use bootstrap.bundle.min.js which contains Popper.
<script src="chickenpaint/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
<script src="chickenpaint/js/chickenpaint.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="chickenpaint/css/chickenpaint.css">
```

Prevent zooming on mobile devices by adding this to your head:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,user-scalable=no">
```

For iOS Safari support, you also need to add this to the head to block the long-press text
selection popup from appearing on your body elements (when not in ChickenPaint full-screen mode):

```html
<style>
body {
	-webkit-user-select: none; /* For iOS Safari: Prevent long-press from popping up a selection dialog on body text */
}
</style>
```

Add an element to serve as the container for ChickenPaint:

```html
<div id="chickenpaint-parent"></div>
```

Then construct ChickenPaint and tell it which DOM element to add to:

```js
new ChickenPaint({
    uiElem: document.getElementById("chickenpaint-parent"),
    saveUrl: "save.php",
    postUrl: "complete.php",
    exitUrl: "index.php",
    resourcesRoot: "chickenpaint/"
});
```

The possible options, including additional options for loading saved .chi or .png files for editing, are described
in the typedef comment for the ChickenPaintOptions object in `/js/ChickenPaint.js`.

See `/example/index.html` for a complete example of a page that hosts ChickenPaint.

Your `saveUrl` will receive the uploaded .chi layer file (if the drawing had multiple layers), flat PNG image (always)
and .aco color palette (if the user edited it), which would arrive in PHP as `$_FILES["picture"]`, `$_FILES["chibifile"]`
and `$_FILES["swatches"]`. For an example of an upload script, see `/example/save.php`.

ChickenPaint's saving workflow has been customised for use on Chicken Smoothie by setting `allowMultipleSends` to `true`
in the options in the constructor. On CS, the user can save their drawing, and then either continue editing the drawing, 
publish their completed drawing to the forum, or exit their drawing session and come back and finish it later. The 
ability to create a new drawing and then save it multiple times before publishing it to the forum effectively requires 
that the saveUrl contains a unique session ID in it. This way each `POST` to the saveUrl can be associated with the same
drawing session.

By default, `allowMultipleSends` is disabled, and the user will only have the option to post their drawing immediately.
This allows a simpler image upload script.
